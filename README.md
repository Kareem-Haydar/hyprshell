# My dotfiles repository

## Contains configs for the following:
- kitty
- tmux
- neovim
- zsh
- hyprland
- system maintenance script (standalone `sys-maintenance` script)

## Installation
To install simply paste the following code into your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kareem-Haydar/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./setup.sh
```
You can also use the setup script to update the configs if you make any changes

## Notes:
- As of now, the setrup script has currently only tested on Arch Linux (CachyOS) and only works on arch based distros, but you can manually install the packages
- If you already have configs for any of these apps, please backup and remove them before running the setup script
- The setup script will only work properly if `dotfiles` is in your home directory

## Other distros
If you are on a distro other than arch, you can install the following packages manually (package names may differ):

- `neovim`
- `kitty`
- `tmux`
- `zsh`
- `hyprland`
- `unzip`
- `npm`
- `nodejs`
- `zoxide`
