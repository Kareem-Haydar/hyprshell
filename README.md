# My dotfiles repository

## Contains configs for the following:
- kitty
- tmux
- neovim
- zsh
- hyprland
- system maintenance script

## Installation
To install simply run this in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kareem-Haydar/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./setup.sh
```
You can also use `setup.sh` to update the configs if you make any changes

## Notes:
- As of now, `setup.sh` has currently only tested on Arch Linux (CachyOS)
- `setup.sh` will only work properly if `dotfiles` is in your home directory
